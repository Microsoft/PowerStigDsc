    .SYNOPSIS
        Apply the Windows DNS Server STIG to a node, but skip the V-58697.a setting

    .DESCRIPTION
        Use embedded STIG data and inject a skipped rule. In this example, the
        Windows DNS Server 2012 R2 V1 R STIG is processed by the composite
        resource and merges in the default values for any settings that have a
        valid range. Additionally, a skip is added inline to the configuration,
        so that the setting in STIG ID V-58697.a would be marked to skip
        configuration when applied.
